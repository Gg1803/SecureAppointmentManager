🚀 Features Implemented
✅ Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

✅ AES-256 Encryption at Rest

✅ TLS Encryption in Transit (HTTPS)

✅ SQL Injection Detection & Alerts

✅ Role-Based Privilege Notification System

✅ Real-Time Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

✅ Automated Email Alerts on Critical Events

✅ Comprehensive Audit Logging & Monitoring

🔒 Why This Project?
Pyramid Education previously managed client data using insecure spreadsheets and third-party storage. Our project mitigates these risks by implementing a secure-by-design appointment system that complies with Australian data privacy laws and meets modern cybersecurity standards.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Backend: Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy

Security: pyotp, AES (Cryptography), smtplib (alerts), custom IDS

Database: SQLite (development), configurable for PostgreSQL

UI: HTML/CSS (Jinja Templates), Tailwind CSS
